  - Allocate students to diploma guiding professors (based on the students' average
grades, the available positions for each professor and students' preferences)
- **Programming Language**: CLIPS

- **Inputs** (grouped in initial facts):
  - Information about the students (ID, name, group, disciplines, grades for exams, laboratories and projects, number of absences for laboratories and projects, options for diploma guding professors)
  - Information about the professors (ID, name, number of places for diploma guidance, preffered exam dates)
  - Information about the disciplines (name, exam, laboratory and project weights for the total average)
  - Information about the scholarships (maximum number, ratio from the total budget)
- **Outputs**:
  - Answers written on the console based on the chosen query / queries
- **Solution** and **Results**:
  - For more information about the solution, implementation, results, conclusions and improvements see [this document](documentation/Documentation.pdf)
